# Hey there! I'm Joshua Reisbord 👋

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm a software developer and tech enthusiast living in the sunny Venice, CA (90291). Here you'll find my experiments, projects, and maybe a few random thoughts about code and tech.

## Who Am I?

I'm currently shaking things up as a Co-Founder at NoHouse, diving deep into the world of real-time sports data and daily fantasy sports. When I'm not there, I'm coding away at Scotiabank, making sure their systems run smoother than a well-oiled machine. 

## My Journey So Far 🚀

- **NoHouse (Sept. 2023 - Now)**: Building cool stuff with real-time data and sports. Think of me as the sports data wizard.
- **Scotiabank (Nov. 2022 - Now)**: Automating all the things and leading a fantastic team. We're all about efficiency and cloud magic.
- **QWeb (2019 - 2022)**: Helping local businesses shine online with custom-built websites and backend solutions.

## Tech Stack: 💻

- **Cloud Magic**: AWS & Google Cloud Platform
- **Code Languages**: Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, SQL
- **Frameworks & Tools**: ReactJS, WebDriver.IO, Jenkins, Docker

## Learning & Growing 🌱

I’m always on the lookout for new things to learn and certifications to earn. Here are a couple I’m proud of:

- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** (Oct 2023)
- **W3Schools JavaScript Certified Developer** (Oct 2023)
- **W3Schools Python Certified Developer** (Oct 2023)
